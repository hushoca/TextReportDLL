#TextReport DLL#
----------

## About ##
This library is created so that I can get fast report files from my programs and I am open-sourcing it because I love to share. Its written in a way that with few lines of code you can get tables, text and nice formatting features in the report. I will mainly use it in small projects where I need logging over a time period.

## Documentation ##
For all the classes and methods please check the help file which is under the Documentation folder. Tried to make the help file as clear and simple as possible also I have an example under the examples folder.

## Features ##

> - Can create a text file by choosing the path and name. Or just a file name (it will create the file in the executable folder)
> - Can create tables from 2D string arrays or by using the Table class built-in.
> - Can be used by beginners because you can easily appendText() or breakLine()
> - Saving returns the path of the created file which makes it easy to open
> - Can create a report with only few lines of code.
> - Well documented.

## Changelog ##
